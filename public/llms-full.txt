# Environments

The Akoya API supports multiple environments. Each environment includes one or more **base URIs** to use for product and authentication requests.

---


## Production

**Sandbox server**

| Server       | Base URI                                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| default      | `https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com`    |
| auth server  | `https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com`         |

---


## Environment2

**Products server**

| Server       | Base URI                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| default      | `https://products.ddp.akoya.com`         |
| auth server  | `https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com`      |

---


## Defaults

- **Default environment** → Production
- **Default server** → Default



# Authorization

This API supports the following authentication schemes:

- **basicAuth** (Basic Authentication)
- **bearerAuth** (OAuth 2 Bearer Token)
- **acgAuth** (OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant)

---


## basicAuth (Basic Authentication)

HTTP Basic Authentication requires **client credentials**. The client credentials are concatenated with a colon (`:`) and Base64-encoded before being sent in the **Authorization** header.

**Example:**

```bash
curl {BASEURI} -u '{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}'
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

---


## bearerAuth (OAuth 2 Bearer Token)

The **bearer token** is sent in the request like this:

```bash
curl {BASEURI} -H 'Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}'
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}
```

---


## acgAuth (OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant)

Documentation for accessing and setting credentials for acgAuth.

### Auth Credentials

| Name              | Type               | Description                                           |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| OAuthClientId     | String             | OAuth 2 Client ID                                    |
| OAuthClientSecret | String             | OAuth 2 Client Secret                                |
| OAuthRedirectUri  | String             | OAuth 2 Redirection endpoint or Callback URI         |
| OAuthScopes       | OAuthScopeAcgAuth  | List of scopes that apply to the OAuth token         |

---


### Steps for Authorization Code Grant Flow

#### 1. Obtain User Consent

Redirect the user to the authorization page with initialized scopes:

{URI for auth server}/?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope={SCOPE}

#### 2. Handle the OAuth Server Response

- If approved, an authorization code is sent:  
  https://example.com/oauth/callback?code=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

- If denied, an error is returned:  
  https://example.com/oauth/callback?error=access_denied

#### 3. Get the OAuth Access Token

Exchange the authorization code for an access token:

```bash
curl -X POST
--url '{URI for auth server}/token'
--user '{CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET}'
--header 'Accept: application/json'
--data 'grant_type=authorization_code'
--data 'code={CODE}'
--data 'redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}'
```

---


### Scopes

Scopes allow your application to only request the resources it needs.

| Scope Name      | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| openid          | OpenID Connect authentication              |
| profile         | Access to user profile information          |
| offline_access  | Request refresh tokens for offline access   |

---


### Refreshing the Token

Access tokens may expire. You can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token:

```bash
curl -X POST
--url '{URI for auth server}/token'
--user '{CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET}'
--header 'Accept: application/json'
--data 'grant_type=refresh_token'
--data 'refresh_token={REFRESH_TOKEN}'
-d 'scope={OPTIONAL_SCOPE}'
```

## Environments

This API has support for the following environment(s). Each environment has one or more base URIs defined.

### Production

Sandbox server

| Server | Base URI |
|  --- | --- |
| default | `https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com` |
| auth server | `https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com` |

### Environment2

Products server

| Server | Base URI |
|  --- | --- |
| default | `https://products.ddp.akoya.com` |
| auth server | `https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com` |

The default environment is **production** and the default server is **default**.

## Authorization

This API uses the following authentication schemes.

* [`basicAuth (Basic Authentication)`]($h/__auth_BasicAuth)
* [`bearerAuth (OAuth 2 Bearer token)`]($h/__auth_BearerAuth)
* [`acgAuth (OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant)`]($h/__auth_AcgAuth)

### basicAuth (Basic Authentication)



HTTP Basic Authentication will need client credentials.

The client credentials are concatenated with a colon (:) and base64-encoded before being sent in the *Authorization* header.

```bash
curl {BASEURI} -u '{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}'
```

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

### bearerAuth (OAuth 2 Bearer token)



The bearer token is sent in the request like this:

```bash
curl {BASEURI} -H 'Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}'
```

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Authorization: Bearer {OAUTH_TOKEN}
```

### acgAuth (OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant)



Documentation for accessing and setting credentials for acgAuth.

#### Auth Credentials

| Name | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| OAuthClientId | String | OAuth 2 Client ID |
| OAuthClientSecret | String | OAuth 2 Client Secret |
| OAuthRedirectUri | String | OAuth 2 Redirection endpoint or Callback Uri |
| OAuthScopes | OAuthScopeAcgAuth | List of scopes that apply to the OAuth token |



Your application must obtain user authorization before it can execute an endpoint call in case this API chooses to use *OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant*. This authorization includes the following steps

#### 1\. Obtain user consent

To obtain user's consent, you must redirect the user to the authorization page. You must have initialized the client with scopes for which you need permission to access.

```bash
{URI for auth server}/?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope={SCOPE}
```

#### 2\. Handle the OAuth server response

Once the user responds to the consent request, the OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by redirecting the user to the redirect URI.

If the user approves the request, the authorization code will be sent as the `code` query string:

```
https://example.com/oauth/callback?code=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

If the user does not approve the request, the response contains an `error` query string:

```
https://example.com/oauth/callback?error=access_denied
```

#### 3\. Get the OAuth access token

After the server receives the code, it can exchange this for an *access token*. The access token is an object containing information for authorizing client requests and refreshing the token itself.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  --url '{URI for auth server}/token' \
  --user '{CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET}' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  --data 'code={CODE}' \
  --data 'redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}'
```

#### Scopes

Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources it needs while enabling users to control the amount of access they grant to your application. The following scopes are available:

| Scope Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| `openid` | OpenID Connect authentication |
| `profile` | Access to user profile information |
| `offline_access` | Request refresh tokens for offline access |

#### Refreshing the token

An access token may expire after sometime. You can exchange the *refresh token* for a new access token.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  --url '{URI for auth server}/token' \
  --user '{CLIENT_ID}:{CLIENT_SECRET}' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
  --data 'refresh_token={REFRESH_TOKEN}' \
  -d 'scope={OPTIONAL_SCOPE}'
```




# Data Access Network

## Introduction to the Data Access Network

Akoya enables consumers to provide third-party access to their financial data in a safe, secure, and transparent way.

![Diagram of Akoya Data Access Network](static\images\guides\introduction\akoya-data-access-networl.png)

---


The Akoya mission is to create trust among financial institutions, fintechs, and data aggregators to ensure mass participation in Open Finance. Akoya secures the way consumers provide access to their data with increased security, privacy, and control over their information by transitioning data aggregation toward application programming interface (API)–based data access.

---


### Akoya is a **facilitator**

- Removes login credentials from data sharing by implementing tokenized access.
- Facilitates a consent flow that enables customers to share their accounts and permission data directly from their data provider.
- Ensures consumers have control through the ability to monitor and disable access.

### Akoya is a **network**

- Does not store any data accessed or shared on its network.
- Maintains a pass-through model to promote privacy for all consumers.
- Akoya does not pick favorites, nor hide providers. Akoya does not know who the consumer is or what data they are sharing.

### Akoya is **different**

- Akoya serves as a data-access network, not a data-aggregation service.
- Akoya delivers tokenized credentials used between a financial data provider and a financial app.
- Akoya does not open the package, inspect it, and repackage it as legacy aggregators do.
- Instead, Akoya simply gifts the package safely from point A to point B.

---


## Features

### Consent flow

The consent flow enables a customer to authenticate, select accounts, and permission data to flow from their data provider through the Data Access Network out to a third-party fintech app. This keeps your customers’ login credentials from being shared with third parties.

*Tip: You may click on images to view in full screen*

![Consent Flow Screenshots](static\images\guides\introduction\consentFlow.png)

**Steps:**

1. Emily wants to connect a fintech app to her financial institution accounts, in this example, at her fictional bank, Mikomo.
2. Emily is redirected by the fintech app to Akoya where the fintech and Mikomo site are validated.
3. Akoya retrieves an auth grant code to Mikomo Bank and Emily authenticates at the Mikomo Bank site.
4. Emily agrees to terms and conditions and gives authorization to provide access of her data to her fintech app.
5. Mikomo Bank issues an authorization grant code to Akoya who in turn requests the Mikomo Bank token.
6. Using Mikomo Bank’s token, Akoya requests Emily’s account list for selection and permissioning to her fintech app. Emily approves account selection.
7. Akoya redirects Emily back to her fintech app with the Akoya auth code.
8. The Akoya auth code is exchanged by the fintech app for an Akoya ID token. The fintech app uses the Akoya token to request Emily’s account details. Akoya uses the Mikomo Bank’s token to request permissioned details.
9. Mikomo Bank returns data to Akoya. Akoya gets the entitlements policy and applies Mikomo Bank’s rules. Akoya then returns the data to the fintech app.
10. Emily sees the permissioned account data.

---


### Akoya API v2

![Akoya API v2 Example](static\images\guides\introduction\akoya-api-v2.png)

Based on Financial Data Exchange (FDX) specifications, the **Akoya API v2** allows recipients to request consumer-permissioned data to flow from a provider through the Data Access Network.

Through data mapping and API integration, Akoya translates responses from providers—even those with proprietary APIs—into a common format. Expected and standard API responses help mitigate the need for proprietary APIs, thereby reducing development costs.

---


### Connection Management

![Connection Management Diagram](static\images\guides\introduction\connectionManagement.png)

The **Management Console** is available for data providers to self-manage their connections and configure their settings in the Akoya Data Access Network.

Akoya also provides aggregators and fintechs with the **Data Recipient Hub** to manage their connection to providers.

---


### Permission API

The Akoya Permission API is used by a data provider to add support to their customer experience for Akoya account permission management.

By making calls to the API, a provider can add a permission dashboard that allows their consumers to see which recipients have access to their permissioned data, add or remove accounts, or remove access overall.

---


### Akoya security and technology

- **FDX** is the primary API interface for data recipients. All APIs are REST.
- **OIDC, OAuth 2.0, and JWT** implemented for authorization and authentication.
- Full monitoring, auditability, and traceability.
- Different logging capabilities available.
- Cloud-native implementation on **AWS** that enables scaling in real-time.
- Akoya’s cloud implementation enables continuous application upgrades across the network.
- Strong in-flight and at-rest encryption.
- Least Privilege Zero-Trust Model.
- Secure application development implemented by **SOC2**.
- **NIST** and FFIEC frameworks leveraged to define and prioritize security controls.
- Akoya is **SOC 2 Type 2** certified.

# Introduction to Mikomo and Sandbox

## Introduction to Mikomo and the Sandbox

We want you to be able to learn our platform and test our APIs in a safe environment with test data, so we created **Mikomo Bank** and a set of test API servers for your use.

---


### What is Mikomo?

Mikomo is a mock data provider managed by Akoya. It contains a number of test user accounts whose response payloads resemble many of the providers on our network.

You can use these accounts to:

- Step through the consent process.
- Retrieve test data.

Since the exact responses vary by provider, you can use specific test accounts to simulate receiving data from that provider.

---


### What is sandbox?

The **sandbox** is a set of test API servers you can use to make calls in a non-production setting.

- You can **ONLY** use our mock provider **Mikomo Bank** with these servers.
- All our API products are configured to use them.
- Our [Akoya API servers](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/akoya-api-servers#sandbox) doc provides a list of these test servers.

---


### How do I get started with the sandbox?

1. Log into the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).
2. Go to **My apps** and create a **sandbox app**.
   - Creating a sandbox app registers a redirect URI with us and generates your API credentials.
   
   - If you don’t have a redirect URI yet, a placeholder redirect URI will populate automatically:
     
     ```
     https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/flow/callback
     ```
     
     You can use this for testing.
3. To make a sandbox API call, ensure you’re using the appropriate sandbox server base URL with our endpoints, for example:
   - `https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com/token`
   - `https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/accounts-info/{version}/{providerId}`

---


### What’s next?

Check out our [Getting started guide](page:getting-started/introduction), where you will step through the entire process of obtaining data using our test API servers.

# Requirements & Best Practices

Tips for integrating your application with the Akoya Data Access Network.

---


## Suggest Edits

We have a number of implementation requirements to ensure the security of our network and your end-users' financial data.

> 🚧 **Please review these requirements before continuing!**

---


## Requirements

### A consent UX in your app

Your end-user should consent to the access and use of their data from the original data provider. The Akoya consent flow leverages [OAuth 2.0 authorization](https://oauth.net/2/). For more information, see:

- [Authorization request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1)
- [Authorization code grant type](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)
- [Refresh token grant type](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)

### Redirect URI(s)

The callback resource in your application where Akoya will send the end-user and authorization code after successful authentication.

### Secure, encrypted storage

Your app must securely store:

- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- All tokens

⚠️ The `client_secret` should **NEVER** be hard-coded into your application's source code.

---


## Best Practices

### One Hub account

- Your company should maintain [one Data Recipient Hub team account](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/data-recipient-hub-user-manual#team-management).
- The first team member to join the Hub should send invitations to the remaining members of the team.
- See: *Data Recipient Hub v5*.

### Token revocation

- Provide a link for the end-user to revoke permission for use of their provider's accounts.

### Pagination

- Build a pagination component into your app, allowing it to receive one page at a time.

### Provider guidelines

- Adhere to implementation differences required by some data providers.
- These guidelines, and other integration considerations, are documented by provider in the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

### Outages

- When major service disruptions occur that impact the network (e.g., invalidating all tokens or forcing re-authentication), please notify Akoya.
- To notify Akoya, sign into the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login) and visit the [Support Center](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/hub-manual-support-tickets#create-a-support-ticket).

### Errors

- For **500-level HTTP errors**, we recommend implementing **three (3) retries** to help your app deal with short-lived, transient failures.
- The waiting time between retries should increase **exponentially** with each retry attempt.

### Versioning

- Akoya limits breaking changes to **major API versions**.
- Minor updates are **non-breaking, backward-compatible improvements** and are released continually.
- When migrating to Akoya API v2, plan for minor version updates and implement in a way that supports non-breaking changes.
- See: [Versioning](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/versioning).

### Requests

- Send the `x-akoya-interaction-type` header with all Akoya product calls to indicate if the request is part of a batch process or a real-time, end-user interaction.
- When using a batch or bulk process, implement your app to handle **HTTP status 429, error code 1207**. If receiving this response, send bulk requests at a slower rate.

### Responses

- Track the header `x-akoya-interaction-id` returned with each Akoya API request.
- Your app should handle **206 HTTP Partial Responses**.

---


## FDX

Akoya API v2 is based on **Financial Data Exchange (FDX)** specifications (learn more about FDX [here](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/intro-to-fdx)). The following FDX guidance is recommended while using Akoya API v2:

- Utilize the FDX API, security, and user experience specifications.
- Follow FDX version recommendations for API deprecation.
- Recipients need not be members of FDX to integrate with the Akoya Data Access Network.
- FDX provides:
  - A variety of membership options.
  - Fee-free access to API specifications by accepting the intellectual property agreement.



# Creating a Test App

An overview of technical implementation steps to integrate with the Akoya Data Access Network.

---


The following steps will guide you through creation of a test app in the Akoya sandbox.

---


## Authenticate & Select Accounts

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Review technical requirements.** | See: [Requirements](page:guides/requirements). |
| **Register with Akoya for sandbox access.** | To register, you must provide Akoya with a redirect URI for your sandbox test app. Akoya will provide you with a **client_id** and **client_secret** for your app. |
| **Securely store client_id and secret.** | Every app has a unique client Id and secret. They must be treated as secure information and stored securely. |
| **UX – Provider popup or redirect.** | Integrate into your existing provider selection UI or build popup/redirect flows for the consumer to select the data provider(s) they'd like to connect with your app. Upon consumer selection, initiate consent and authentication via Akoya to the provider. See: [Native app integrations](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/native-app-integrations). |
| **Use sandbox data for implementation and testing.** | The Akoya sandbox includes a mock data provider (**Mikomo Financial**) with several test users that may be used for end-to-end implementation and testing. Use these test accounts for the remaining implementation steps. See: [Introduction to Sandbox](https://docs.akoya.com/docs/mikomo). |
| **Authorization grant.** | After authentication and authorization, Akoya will return the consumer to your redirect URI with an authorization grant code in the URL with the parameter `code=`. Use this authorization code to request a set of tokens for this consumer. See: [Authorization Code]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info). |
| **Store x-akoya-interaction-id.** | Akoya returns an interaction id in every response header. Retain the id with logs for support and error tracking. |

# Pagination

When dealing with large sets of data, receiving results in segments can help apps process information in a more structured way. This retrieval of data, a page at a time, is called **pagination**.

The **`/transactions`** endpoint standardizes on **link-based pagination** with Akoya API v2.

Consider the following when implementing link-based pagination.

---


## 1️⃣ First Request

When making an initial transaction call, create the request with the following parameters. The result of that first request will return **links** to use for paging.

### Parameters

These parameters should only be used in constructing the **first transaction call**. After the first call, requesting pages must be done with links provided in results.

Some data providers may not support `offset` or `limit`. Check the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login) for provider-specific pagination support.

- **offset** – The number of items to skip before the first in the response
- **limit** – The maximum number of items to be returned in the response
- **startTime** – ISO 8601 date format in UTC (e.g., `2020-03-30T04:00:00Z`)
- **endTime** – ISO 8601 date format in UTC (e.g., `2021-03-30T04:00:00Z`)

**Note:** When using Akoya’s link-based pagination, we recommend **omitting `offset`** in the initial call.

---


### Example Request

**Parameters:**

- `providerId = mikomo`
- `accountId = g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429`
- `limit = 5`
- `startTime = 2019-02-26T00:00:00Z`
- `endTime = 2021-02-26T00:00:00Z`

**cURL:**

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/transactions/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429?startTime=2019-02-26T00:00:00Z&endTime=2021-02-26T00:00:00Z&limit=5' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{idToken}}'
```

### Example Response with Paging

The value of links.next.href may contain the offset, limit, startTime, and endTime parameters.
**Do not change these values — use the link as provided**.

```json
{
  "links": {
    "next": {
      "href": "/transactions/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429?endTime=2021-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit=5&offset=5&startTime=2019-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z"
    },
    "prev": {
      "href": "/transactions/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429?endTime=2021-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit=5&offset=0&startTime=2019-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z"
    }
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "depositTransaction": {
        "accountId": "g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429",
        "amount": -449.07,
        "checkNumber": 31505,
        "description": "CHECK",
        "postedTimestamp": "2019-07-08T00:00:00Z",
        "status": "POSTED",
        "transactionId": "30191890000030",
        "transactionTimestamp": "2019-07-08T00:00:00Z",
        "transactionType": "CHECK"
      }
    },
    {
      "depositTransaction": {
        "accountId": "g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429",
        "amount": -4000.4,
        "checkNumber": 31528,
        "description": "CHECK",
        "postedTimestamp": "2019-07-08T00:00:00Z",
        "status": "POSTED",
        "transactionId": "30191890000020",
        "transactionTimestamp": "2019-07-08T00:00:00Z",
        "transactionType": "CHECK"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Without Pagination

If all data can be returned without paging, links.next.href will be empty.

**Example with sandbox user mikomo_10, accountId = "5426873":**

```json
{
  "links": {
    "prev": {
      "href": "/transactions/v2/mikomo/5426873?endTime=2021-05-19T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit=50&offset=0&startTime=2021-05-16T00%3A00%3A00Z"
    }
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "investmentTransaction": {
        "accountId": "5426873",
        "amount": -30000,
        "description": "CHASE DEPOSIT SWEEP JPMORGAN CHASE BANK NA INTRA-DAY DEPOSIT",
        "postedTimestamp": "2021-05-17T00:00:00Z",
        "status": "POSTED",
        "transactionId": "TX-300000020210517#20210517--1321227038",
        "transactionType": "PURCHASED",
        "transferAction": "OUT",
        "units": 30000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---


## 2️⃣ Second Request

Use the links.next.href value in the first response payload to construct the next call.
**Do not change the link.** Editing offset, startTime, endTime, or limit in the provided link may cause errors or missing data.

### Example links response snippet:

```json
"links": {
  "next": {
    "href": "/transactions/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429?endTime=2021-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit=5&offset=5&startTime=2019-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z"
  },
  "prev": {
    "href": "/transactions/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429?endTime=2021-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit=5&offset=0&startTime=2019-02-26T00%3A00%3A00Z"
  }
}
```

### Next Page Request

Use links.next.href directly:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://{access_url}{{links.next.href}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{idToken}}'
```

### Previous Page Request

Most pagination responses include links.prev.href to page back.
Some providers do not support prev. If prev is not supported and your app requires it, store the next links as the user pages.

## 3️⃣ Ongoing Requests

Continue making requests using the provided links until next is no longer returned in the response.



# Timestamp Formatting

Below is an explanation of the timestamp formatting Akoya expects in requests, and how timestamps are returned.

---


## Requests

Akoya follows **FDX standards** for timestamps in requests.

The `startTime` and `endTime` query parameters for the **Transactions endpoint** must follow [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339), an extension of the [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format requiring both **date and time** in the string.

- The time must be in **UTC**.

**Data type:** `string`

**Example input:**  
2019-02-26T00:00:00Z

**Note:** When specifying a time range, both `startTime` and `endTime` must be used.

---


## Responses

After you submit your request:

1. Akoya converts the timestamp into whichever ISO8601 format that the **data provider** uses.
2. Akoya passes the request on to the provider.
3. The response is returned back to you **as-is**.

Providers may use any valid ISO8601 format. Your implementation should handle these differences either:

- By customizing per provider, or
- By using a robust **date/time library** in your application.

---


### Returned Timestamp Examples

- `2021-07-15T14:46:41.375Z`
- `2019-09-16T00:00:00.000+0000`
- `2022-01-31T05:00:00Z`
- `2021-08-09`

# Tokenized Account Numbers (TAN)

The number of financial payments that depend on the **ACH** and **RTP** networks is growing rapidly. Traditionally, these payments require knowing and holding a customer’s account and routing numbers. The storing and transfer of this sensitive information is inherently risky and increases the likelihood of financial fraud.

One solution to decrease risk is to use **tokenized account numbers (TANs)** to replace standard account numbers. Tokenizing account numbers is a solution gaining momentum across the industry, and several Akoya data providers support TANs.

---


## What Are TANs?

- TANs protect account numbers by replacing the actual account number with a **token**, a randomly generated number.
- The token allows you to still perform a payment **without sharing the actual account numbers**.
- The token is stored in a separate location from the actual account number and routing information, while the **token-to-account mapping** is stored in a secure vault.

**Key points:**

- Tokens have the same **form-factor** as actual account numbers.
- The **routing transit number** is different, but uses the same routing and account structure.
- The Clearing House (TCH) launched **Secure Token Exchange (STE)** to tokenize account numbers in a way that does not alter existing payment authorizations.

---


## Benefits of TANs

If there is a data breach of any participant, TANs provide these benefits:

- Mapping is separate and validated during payment processing → limits token’s value to fraudsters.
- One or many tokens can be **systematically turned off** to mitigate risk.
- Replacing tokens (if needed) is **faster and cheaper** than replacing real account numbers.

---


## Troubleshooting TANs

Since TANs are new, you may need to adapt systems built for standard account numbers.

👉 You can determine if an account number is tokenized by checking a **Payments API** response:

- If `paymentNetworks.identifierType = TOKENIZED_ACCOUNT_NUMBER`, then the account number is tokenized.

See: [Payments]($e/Payments/payment-networks)

---


### Common ACH R04 Error: Account Not Found

The **ACH R04** return code means invalid account number or account not found.  
When using TANs, this can happen if:

1. **Mismatched routing/account type**
   
   - TAN with standard routing number, or
   - Standard account number with TAN routing number.

2. **Former account numbers**
   
   - Customers may still have old standard account numbers in the system. These **cannot** replace TANs.

3. **Digit truncation**
   
   - TANs can vary by institution but are never more than **17 digits**.
   - Always start with `00`.
   - Do not drop digits (beyond the two leading zeros if needed). Dropping digits may cause an R04 error.

4. **Disabled TANs**
   
   - If a consent is revoked, the associated TAN is disabled.
   - Errors may occur if TANs are used after consent removal or expiration.
   - TANs require ongoing consent, not a one-time authorization.

# Account Verification Use Case

---


## Suggest Edits

Your goal is to **verify the account number and routing number information** that has been retrieved from the end-user.

Use the **Akoya API endpoints** to retrieve the account numbers and routing numbers of a consumer’s account directly from their financial institution’s APIs.

Matching the account numbers and routing numbers from the end-user with the numbers from the Akoya API endpoints verifies the account.

Account verification relies on the **Akoya Payments product**.

👉 For more information, see the blog post [Instant Account Verification with Akoya](https://akoya.com/blog/account-verification).

---


## Prerequisites

The API calls require you to have the **account holder’s consent**. Each data call requires the end-user’s associated **id token**.

- See [Get authorization code]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) for the user authorization process.
- See [Token](https://docs.akoya.com/reference/get-token) to obtain the bearer token for the API calls.

---


## Retrieve Account Information

The [account information endpoint]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) is a standalone endpoint that supplies useful account information.

You need to retrieve a list of available accounts permissioned by the account holder from this endpoint.

**Request format:**  
GET /accounts-info/{version}/{providerId}

- `{version}`: The Akoya major version number (use `v2`).
- `{providerId}`: The shortened version of the bank data provider name (e.g., `mikomo` for Mikomo, our fictional provider).
- You can find the `providerId` for each bank listed under the **Data providers** tab of the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

### Retrieve account information cURL example

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/accounts-info/v2/mikomo?accountIds=%3AaccountId \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

---


### Find accountId

From the results of the account information call, locate the accountId of the selected account.
This key is used for retrieving the payments credentials (account and routing numbers).

**Example account information response**

```json
{
  "depositAccount": {
    "accountId": "g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429",
    "accountType": "CHECKING",
    "accountNumberDisplay": "xxxxxxxx0071",
    "currency": {
      "currencyCode": "USD"
    },
    "description": "Checking Plus",
    "fiAttributes": [
      {
        "name": "accountOpenedDate",
        "value": "2020-04-23"
      },
      {
        "name": "interestPaidLastYear",
        "value": "3.20"
      }
    ],
    "nickname": "Nickname Checking Plus 0071",
    "productName": "Checking Plus",
    "status": "OPEN",
    "lineOfBusiness": "Personal",
    "balanceType": "ASSET",
    "interestRate": 0.0125,
    "interestRateType": "FIXED",
    "interestRateAsOf": "2022-03-24T14:15:22Z",
    "lastActivityDate": "2022-03-24T14:15:22Z"
  }
}
```

---


### Retrieve Routing and Account Numbers from Bank

The [payments endpoint]($e/Payments/payment-networks) supplies payment information, including the routing and account numbers.
Since this information is retrieved directly from the bank’s APIs, it qualifies as a verified account number under the Nacha WEB debit rule.
**Request format:**

```bash
GET /payments/{version}/{providerId}/{accountId}/payment-networks
```

- {version}: The Akoya major version number (use v2).
- {providerId}: The shortened version of the bank data provider name.
- {accountId}: Retrieved from the account information call.

### Retrieve payment information cURL example

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/payments/v2/mikomo/g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429/payment-networks \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

---


### Find Routing and Account Numbers

- bankId = Routing number
- identifier = Account number

**Example payment information response**

```json
{
  "paymentNetworks": [
    {
      "transferOut": true,
      "identifier": "454992210071",
      "bankId": "125000024",
      "transferIn": true,
      "identifierType": "ACCOUNT_NUMBER",
      "type": "US_ACH"
    }
  ]
}
```

---


### Compare Account and Routing Numbers

Compare the routing and account numbers submitted by the user with the verified routing and account numbers you obtained from the Akoya endpoints.



# Account ownership validation use case

Existing methods of account ownership validation rely on basic username and password authentication. Usernames and passwords are one of the most vulnerable areas in consumer security and subject to phishing and direct hacking attempts. Compromised credentials are the most common avenue to account takeover and fraudulent representation of account ownership.

Akoya's Customers product offers a higher level of account ownership validation. You use Akoya's API to retrieve consumer permissioned information directly from the financial institution. Data elements such as first name, last name, mailing address, e-mail address, or phone number can be used as part of a validation process. You can compare this user information retrieved from the linked external account with what you have captured directly from the end user.

The comparison process can data elements as part of a scoring algorithm comparing user-provided information with the information on file at the financial institutions. This allows data recipients to identify and flag fraud attempts during know your customer processes or whenever fraud is suspected.

For more information, see the blog post The Expansion of [Account Ownership Validation Methods](https://akoya.com/blog/account-ownership-validation-methods).

## Prerequisites

The API calls require you to have the account holder's consent. Each data call requires the end-user's associated id token.

- See [Get authorization code]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) for the user authorization process
- See [Token]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) to obtain the bearer token for the API calls

## 1. Retrieve customer info

The [customer info endpoint]($e/Customers/customer-info) (/customers) response returns information about the end user that you can use as data points to validate account ownership. The specific end user is identified with the id_token used for the Akoya API call. The id_token is created with the authorization code generated when the user consents to sharing their data.

Make the GET request customers/{version}/{providerId}/current

- The {version} parameter is the Akoya major version number. Use v2.
- The {providerId} parameter is the shortened version of the bank data provider name, example, mikomo for Mikomo, our fictional data provider. You can find the providerId for each bank listed under the Data providers tab of the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

### Retrieve customer info curl example

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/customers/v2/mikomo/current \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

## 2. Find data elements for the validation process

The API response contains data elements for the end user, such as first name, last name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number. Compare these data elements from the Akoya endpoint against the data elements submitted by the end user. Developers often implement a scoring algorithm to facilitate the comparison and flag possible fraud.
Customer info results example

```json
{
    "customer": {
        "customerId": "1521963501",
        "name": {
            "last": "Last",
            "first": "First",
            "middle": "H"
        },
        "telephones": [
            {
                "number": "9585550103"
            }
        ],
        "addresses": [
            {
                "state": "TN",
                "city": "SPRINGFIELD",
                "line1": "7572 Road Rd",
                "postalCode": "37172-6488"
            }
        ],
        "email": [
            "user@example.com"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Alternative retrieval of customer information

Some data providers do not support the default [customer info endpoint]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info). Use the below procedure and the account holder information endpoint for these providers.

### Retrieve account information

The [account information endpoint]($e/Customers/get-account-holder) is a standalone endpoint that supplies useful account information. You need to retrieve a list of available accounts permissioned by the account holder from this endpoint.
Make the GET request /accounts-info/{version}/{providerId}

- The {version} parameter is the Akoya major version number. Use v2.
- The {providerId} parameter is the shortened version of the bank data provider name, example, mikomo for Mikomo, our fictional data provider. You can find the providerId for each bank listed under the Data providers tab of the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

**Retrieve account information curl example**

```bash
curl --request GET \
 --url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/accounts-info/v2/mikomo?accountIds=%3AaccountId \
 --header 'accept: application/json' \
 --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

### Find the accountId

From the results of the retrieve account information call, find the the accountId of the selected account. This is the key for retrieving the customer information data elements.
**Account information results example**

```json
{
 "depositAccount": {
 "accountId": "g833202fb0866d0ad83472c429",
 "accountType": "CHECKING",
 "accountNumberDisplay": "xxxxxxxx0071",
 "currency": {
 "currencyCode": "USD"
 },
 "description": "Checking Plus",
 "fiAttributes": []
 .....
 }
}
```

## Request account holder information

The account holder information endpoint (/contacts) response returns information about the end user that you can use as data points to validate account ownership. This API call uses the accountId to designate the end user. It is based on FDX 5.2.1.
Make the GET request contacts/{version}/{providerId}/{accountId}

- The {version} parameter is the Akoya major version number. Use v2.
- The {providerId} parameter is the shortened version of the bank data provider name, example, mikomo for Mikomo, our fictional data provider. You can find the providerId for each bank listed under the Data providers tab of the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).
- You retrieved the {accountId} with the retrieve account information call.

**Retrieve account holder information example**

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/contacts/v2/mikomo/1234 \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

## Find data elements for the validation process

The API response contains data elements for the end user, such as first name, last name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number. Compare these data elements from the Akoya endpoint against the data elements submitted by the end user. Developers often implement a scoring algorithm to facilitate the comparison and flag possible fraud.

**Retrieve account holder information results example**

```json
{
    "customer": {
        "customerId": "1521963501",
        "name": {
            "last": "Last",
            "first": "First",
            "middle": "H"
        },
        "telephones": [
            {
                "number": "9585550103"
            }
        ],
        "addresses": [
            {
                "state": "TN",
                "city": "SPRINGFIELD",
                "line1": "7572 Road Rd",
                "postalCode": "37172-6488"
            }
        ],
        "email": [
            "user@example.com"
        ]
    }
}
```



# Account linking and consent use case

Traditional account linking and consent flow depends on credential-based screen scraping. This process is heavily reliant on consumer credentials, which can lead to issues with data security, negative user experiences, and high website traffic. Scraped data is also less reliable and prone to errors.

Akoya offers a better solution. It provides an API-only, permissioned-driven open finance network that overcomes the inherent problems of screen scraping.

From a customer viewpoint, the process to link an account and give consent through Akoya is simple. The new app routes the user to their existing bank portal. The user completes the normal authentication process and consents to link the account.

The process for a developer begins with the consent flow. This enables a customer to authenticate, select accounts, and permission data to flow from their data provider through the Data Access Network and to a third-party fintech app. This keeps your customers' sign in credentials from being shared with third parties.

After authentication and authorization, Akoya returns the end-user to your redirect URI with an authorization grant code in the URL. This use case procedure began after you receive that authorization grant code.

For more information, see the blog post [A Consumer-First Approach to Account Linking](https://akoya.com/blog/account-linking).

---


## Prerequisites

The API calls require you to have joined the Data Recipient Hub and set up your app to work with the Akoya Data Access Network (DAN). For more information on these processes, refer to these resources:

- [Onboarding: Getting started](page:getting-started/introduction)
- [How to work with Akoya](page:guides/preparing-to-integrate)

---


## Find the authorization code

Akoya returns the end-user to your redirect URI with an authorization grant code in the URL. code= precedes the grant code. The code fogeqqbz2xi23hvgvlu4ka2kq is shown in the example. For more information, see Get authorization code.

### Callback success example

```http
https://example-app.com/callback?code=fogeqqbz2xi23hvgvlu4ka2kq&state=123abc
```

---


## Exchange the code for an ID and refresh token

The token endpoint response returns an id_token and a refresh_token. The id_token is the bearer token used for data calls. Use the refresh_token retrieves a new set of tokens. For more information, see Tokens.

Make the GET request /token for an id token.

- Set the grant_type to authorization_code.
- The redirect_uri is the URI where user will be redirected after end-users authorization is complete.
- The code is the authorization grant code retrieved in step 1.

### Exchange code for tokens curl example

```bash
curl --request POST
--url https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com/token
--header 'accept: application/json'
--header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
--data grant_type=authorization_code
--data redirect_uri=https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/flow/callback
--data 'code=<authorization-code>'
```

---


## Find and copy the token strings

The API response contains the id_token and refresh_token strings. Copy and store these values in a safe place. Use your current secure token storage or implement a way to store each end-user's unique tokens.

### Token results example

```json
{
"expires_in": 86399,
"id_token": "<id-token>",
"refresh_token": "<refresh-token",
"scope": "openid offline_access",
"token_type": "bearer"
}
```

---


## Refresh tokens

Repeat your get request on the token endpoint with different parameters to obtain a new set of tokens. The refresh token expiration is set by the data provider.

Make the GET request /token to refresh tokens.

- Set the grant_type to refresh_token.
- The refresh_token is in the results from the tokens call in step 1.
- The client_id is your app's client ID from Akoya
- The client_secret is your app's client secret from Akoya

You can find the client_id and client_secret under the My app tab of the [Akoya Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

### Refresh tokens curl example

```bash
curl --request POST 
--url https://sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com/token 
--header 'accept: application/json' 
--header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
--data grant_type=refresh_token 
--data 'refresh_token=<refresh-token>' 
--data 'client_id=<client-id>' 
--data 'client_secret=<client-secret>'
```

The refresh tokens result is the same format as the token results example.



# PFM Account Aggregation Use Case

Users often have multiple accounts across different financial institutions. Personal Financial Management (PFM) solutions must consolidate this information into one place to provide an accurate view of a consumer’s financial condition.

The aggregation service must securely consolidate and provide real-time access to all relevant financial data while maintaining **privacy** and **consent**.

You can achieve this by integrating the **Akoya API** into your solution. The [Akoya Investments](https://docs.akoya.com/reference/investments) (or [Balances](https://docs.akoya.com/reference/balances)) and [Transactions]($e/Transactions/get-transactions) products let data recipients and users view and manage their money in a consolidated manner.

These products access financial account data from multiple institutions and present the collated details to the user.

For more information, see the blog post: [The Expansion of Account Ownership Validation Methods](https://akoya.com/blog/account-ownership-validation-methods).

---


## Prerequisites

- The API calls require the **account holder’s consent**.
- Each data call requires the **end-user’s associated id token**.

🔗 See:

- [Get authorization code]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) for the user authorization process
- [Token]($e/Account%20information/get-accounts-info) to obtain the bearer token for the API calls

---


## Retrieve Investments Information

The **Investments product**’s `/accounts` endpoint is standalone.  
It supplies:

- Balance data
- Extended investment details
- Basic account information

### Request

**GET** `/accounts/{version}/{providerId}`

- `{version}` = Akoya major version (use **v2**)
- `{providerId}` = shortened version of bank provider name (e.g., `mikomo` for fictional provider Mikomo)

👉 You can find `providerId` values in the **Data providers tab** of the [Data Recipient Hub](https://recipient.ddp.akoya.com/login).

### Example (Retrieve Investments - cURL)

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/accounts/v2/mikomo \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

## Find accountIds of Permissioned Accounts

From the investments response, gather:

- accountIds of permissioned accounts
- Associated holdings and balances

### Example Response

```json
{
    "accountId": "426444887",
    "accountType": "IRA",
    "accountNumberDisplay": "*****5071",

            "balanceName": "Minimumequitycall",
            "balanceType": "AMOUNT",
            "balanceValue": 0,
            "currency": { "currencyCode": "USD" }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Retrieve and Paginate Transactions

The Transactions product retrieves up to two years of transaction history for an account.
It requires the accountId retrieved earlier.

### Request

GET /transactions/{version}/{providerId}/{accountId}

- {version} = v2
- {providerId} = bank provider ID
- {accountId} = retrieved account ID

**Example (Retrieve Transactions - cURL)**
This retrieves the first 50 transactions (default offset = 0, limit = 50).

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com/transactions/v2/mikomo/5242702?offset=0&limit=50' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <id_token>'
```

**Example Response (Transactions Without Paging)**

```json
{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "depositTransaction": {
                "accountId": "5242702",
                "transactionId": "0203300000020",
                "postedTimestamp": "2020-11-25T00:00:00Z",

                "description": "Manual banking 11/25",
                "status": "POSTED",
                "amount": -51.74,
                "transactionType": "TRANSFER"
            }
        },
        {
            "depositTransaction": {
                "accountId": "5242702",
                "transactionId": "0203300000010",
                "postedTimestamp": "2020-11-25T00:00:00Z",

                "transactionType": "POSCREDIT"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Transaction Pagination

Transactions often exceed the default 50 transaction limit.

Pagination links at the top of the results reference additional records.
Pagination uses offset, limit, and time parameters.

Use these links to make further calls and retrieve all data needed.
For details, see [Transactions Pagination](page:guides/pagination).

## Repeat for Additional Accounts

You must repeat the steps for:

- Each financial institution (providerId)
- Each account at those institutions (accountId)
